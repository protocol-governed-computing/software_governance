## 1. Intent

Actor context under which the Collatz reference workflow executes. This is the Authority concern at
its declaration/binding stage: a named actor that the workflow binds and the runtime propagates into
the execution context and attributes in the trace.

**Scope note:** this artifact declares an actor *identity/context* only. It does NOT implement
authorization or enforcement — real authority checks belong to the governance/authority model and are
out of scope here. The reference value is the lifecycle it demonstrates:
`declaration → workflow binding → runtime context propagation → trace attribution`.
