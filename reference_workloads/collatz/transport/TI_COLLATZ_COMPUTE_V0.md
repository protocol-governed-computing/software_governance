# TI_COLLATZ_COMPUTE_V0

**Kind:** Transport Ingress Contract (Transport Standard V0 §6)
**Operation Identity:** `collatz.compute`
**Home:** platform-resident boundary declaration for the Collatz reference workload.
**Status:** cut-#1 hand-authored. Promoted to a compiler-recognized `TI_` kind in Phase 3.

Declares the admission semantics for the operation `collatz.compute`: its input
contract, the handler it binds to, and how the canonical input maps onto that handler.
The public identity `collatz.compute` is stable; the bound workflow
`workload::WF_COLLATZ_CONJECTURE_V0` is an implementation detail and may be
re-pointed without any adapter change (`OPERATION_IDENTITY_INDEPENDENCE`, Patch 1).

`handler.kind` is the generalization point: `WF_INVOCATION` here; a future
`SNAPSHOT_QUERY` (for `pi.query` over the platform-resident PPS) is a sibling kind,
added without touching the transport engine.
