# INVARIANT_TRANSPORT_TARGET_EXISTS_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_INVARIANTS_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_validation
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  applies_to_kinds:
  - TI
  - TE
  - WF
```

---

## Purpose

Every transport ingress must have a verified, static workflow target. A TI_ artifact
with no resolvable workflow binding is a dead letter — a boundary with no destination.
The compiler enforces this at build time so runtime never encounters an unroutable payload.

---

## Scope

**Applies to:** All TI_ artifacts

**Does NOT apply to:**
- TE_ artifacts (egress has no workflow binding)
- WF_ artifacts (workflows declare their own steps, not transport bindings)

---

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'Every TI_ artifact MUST declare an explicit workflow binding, and the declared workflow
    MUST exist in the compiled artifact set.

    Transport ingress is the system boundary. It must be fully closed at compile time: - The target workflow
    is declared statically (no inference, no fallback resolution) - The declared workflow FQDN resolves
    to an existing WF artifact - No TI_ artifact may be admitted without a resolvable target

    This invariant ensures that no transport ingress point leads to a dead end at runtime. Every admitted
    payload has a guaranteed, verified execution target.

  anti_patterns:
  - missing_workflow_binding: 'TI artifact omits core.workflow field

      '
  - unresolvable_workflow_ref: 'TI core.workflow declares a WF FQDN that does not exist in the snapshot

      '
  - dynamic_workflow_ref: 'TI core.workflow uses a runtime-computed reference ($ prefix)

      '
  - null_or_empty_workflow: TI core.workflow is declared but empty or null
```
