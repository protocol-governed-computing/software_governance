# INVARIANT_TRANSPORT_NO_DYNAMIC_ROUTING_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_INVARIANTS_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_validation
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  scope:
    applies_to:
    - TI
    - TE
```

---

## Purpose

Transport artifacts are compile-time declarations. The routing from transport
ingress to execution workflow is fully resolved at compile time and stored in
the snapshot. Runtime has no routing decisions to make — it reads the static
binding and executes it.

This invariant ensures that transport remains a pure static membrane, not a
routing engine.

---

## Scope

**Applies to:** All TI_ and TE_ artifacts

**Does NOT apply to:**
- Outcome routing within a CC node (that is execution semantics)
- Workflow-internal DAG branching (governed by WF assertions)

---

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'Transport routing MUST be static and explicit. No conditional routing logic, dynamic target
    resolution, or runtime dispatch declarations are permitted in TI_ or TE_ artifacts.

    Transport is a static binding layer. Routing decisions are made at compile time, not at runtime. Any
    routing that requires inspection of runtime context, payload values, or dynamic references collapses
    the transport/execution separation and is forbidden.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - conditional_workflow_selection: 'TI declares if/else or match routing to select between workflows

      '
  - dynamic_workflow_reference: 'TI core.workflow uses a $ prefix (runtime-computed reference)

      '
  - wildcard_routing: 'Transport artifact uses * or ? in routing declarations

      '
  - runtime_dispatch_key: 'Transport artifact declares route_by, dispatch, switch, or when keys

      '
  - payload_dependent_routing: Routing target is determined by inspecting payload field values at runtime
```
