# CONSTITUTION_TRANSPORT_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: CONSTITUTION
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_GOVERNANCE_V0
core:
  enforcement_model: process_enforced
  governs:
  - TI
  - TE
rules: []
```

## Purpose

This constitution governs Transport Ingress (TI) and Transport Egress (TE) artifacts,
which declare the protocol membrane between external clients and internal workflows.

Transport artifacts define:
- Ingress admission contracts (route, method, schema validation, canonical envelope)
- Egress projection contracts (response schema, rendering envelope, serialization)
- HTTP status mapping rules
- Gateway invocation boundaries

This constitution is domain-independent and applies uniformly across all transport protocols.

## 0. Machine Contract

The following sections are normative and machine-enforced:

Section 3 — Artifact Identity & Immutability

Section 4 — Structural Constraints

Section 6 — Execution Boundaries

Section 8 — Membrane Semantics

Section 9 — Observability & Replay Policy

Section 10 — Validation & Enforcement

Only machine-parsable content is authoritative.
Prose, commentary, and examples are non-normative and MUST NOT be used for execution, validation, or inference.

## 1. Scope & Authority

### 1.1 What This Constitution Governs

TI_ artifact identity and structure

TE_ artifact identity and structure

Transport-to-workflow binding boundaries

Admission schema declaration

Egress projection schema declaration

Route registration semantics

### 1.2 What This Constitution Does NOT Govern

Workflow logic

Execution ordering

Side effects

Business rules

Blockchain state

Event observation records (governed by CONSTITUTION_EVENT_V0)

## 2. Canonical Definitions

### 2.1 Governance Terminology

Transport Ingress (TI)
A declarative admission contract for an external entry point into the protocol.
Declares: accepted format, normalized payload schema, explicit target mapping, envelope rules.

Transport Egress (TE)
A declarative projection contract for outbound response rendering.
Declares: response schema, rendering envelope, serialization contract, deterministic error projection.

Admission Schema
A structural validation contract for inbound requests.

Canonical Admission Envelope
The transport-agnostic payload shape produced by TI normalization.
This is the ONLY thing the runtime sees after transport admission.

### 2.2 Vocabulary Authority

TI identifiers MUST use prefix TI_ and format TI_<NAME>_V<MAJOR>

TE identifiers MUST use prefix TE_ and format TE_<NAME>_V<MAJOR>

TI artifacts use artifact_kind: intent

TE artifacts use artifact_kind: transport_egress

EV_ (event) artifacts are NOT transport artifacts. They are governed by CONSTITUTION_EVENT_V0.

## 3. Artifact Identity & Immutability

### 3.1 Naming Rules

TI identifiers MUST be versioned and immutable

TE identifiers MUST be versioned and immutable

### 3.2 Version Semantics

MAJOR: Breaking change to schema or route

MINOR: Backward-compatible additions

PATCH: Documentation only

## 4. Structural Constraints

### 4.1 TI Permitted Contents

A TI artifact MUST declare:

Route specification (method, path, content_type)

Admission schema (field-level validation rules)

Target workflow binding

Outcomes (ACK/NACK)

### 4.2 TI Forbidden Structures

TI artifacts MUST NOT contain:

Execution steps

Capability references

Side effects

Conditional logic

### 4.3 TE Permitted Contents

A TE artifact MUST declare:

Response schema (field-level specification)

Rendering envelope

Serialization contract

Deterministic error projection rules

### 4.4 TE Forbidden Contents

TE artifacts MUST NOT contain:

Execution instructions

Conditional routing logic

References to future actions

Side-effect declarations

Execution state mutation

## 5. Behavioral Guarantees (Advisory)

TI artifacts are inert until bound by a governed Workflow

TE artifacts do not cause behavior — they project execution results

Transport is the protocol membrane — it MUST NOT interpret business semantics

## 6. Execution Boundaries

### 6.1 TI Non-Executability

TI artifacts MUST NOT be directly executable

Engines MUST route TI nodes to admission validation only

### 6.2 Binding Requirement

TI artifacts MAY ONLY be consumed by governed Workflows

TI artifacts bind to workflows — not to CCs or CSs directly

### 6.3 Admission Ownership

Admission validation MUST be performed by governed Capability Contracts (CC)

Server implementations MUST NOT interpret admission schemas directly

### 6.4 Ownership Transfer

Transport owns the canonical admission envelope until admission completes.

After admission:
- Execution owns the envelope immutably
- Transport may no longer mutate execution inputs
- Runtime may not enrich or reinterpret transport metadata

## 7. Composition Rules

TI artifacts MUST NOT compose other artifacts

TE artifacts MUST NOT compose other artifacts

## 8. Membrane Semantics

### 8.1 Transport Exit Reasons

HTTP_xxx exit reasons are transport-domain only

HTTP_xxx reasons MUST NOT be added to VOCAB_EXECUTION_STATES_V0

### 8.2 CS Ownership Boundary

CS artifacts invoked by transport workflows are infrastructure-owned

Transport only binds to infrastructure CS via runtime bindings

Transport MUST NOT own execution mechanisms

### 8.3 Weight Constraint

Transport is a membrane — it MUST remain thinner than domain modules

## 9. Observability & Replay Policy

TI receipt MUST be traceable

TE emission MUST generate trace records

Transport trace records MUST be replayable

Observation records (request received, response sent) are EV_ artifacts — not TE_.

## 10. Validation & Enforcement

### 10.1 Static Validation

Schema validation

Identity validation

Route uniqueness validation

### 10.2 Runtime Guards

Reject undeclared routes

Reject malformed admission schemas

## 11. Governance Authority

This constitution is federal and authoritative.

All TI_ and TE_ artifacts MUST conform to this constitution without modification.

## 12. Versioning

This constitution is versioned and immutable.

Any change requires:

A new version

Explicit migration rationale

Backward-compatibility assessment
