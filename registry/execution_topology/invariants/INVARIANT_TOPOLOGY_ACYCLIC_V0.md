## Purpose

Ensure the compiled topology graph has no circular dependencies. Cycles make compilation non-terminating and execution ordering undefined.

**Core Principle**: Governed topology is always a DAG. Cycles are structurally inadmissible.

---

## How it is checked
### Rule 1: No Transitive Dependency Cycles

The dependency subgraph (filtered to dependency-carrying edge kinds) must admit a topological ordering.

**Violation**:
```
CC_A → CT_X → (via MOLECULE_COMPOSES_ATOM) → CT_Y → (via CC binding) → CC_A
```

**Detection**: Standard cycle detection (DFS-based or Kahn's algorithm) on the dependency-edge-filtered subgraph.

---

## Scope

**Applies to**: Entire compiled graph (all nodes, dependency edges only)

**Does NOT apply to**: Governance edges (GOVERNED_BY, ASSERTED_BY, INVARIANT_APPLIES) — these are metadata, not dependencies.

---

## Rationale

**Acyclic topology = well-ordered compilation and execution**

- Topological ordering guarantees deterministic stage processing
- No infinite loops in dependency resolution
- Foundation for deterministic semantic addressing

---

## What this realizes
```yaml
core:
  description: 'The compiled semantic topology graph must be acyclic across all dependency-carrying edge
    kinds. Cycles in the dependency graph indicate structural contradictions — an artifact cannot depend
    on itself transitively. This is a constitutional property of governed topology: admissible graphs
    are always DAGs.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - cyclic_dependency: Artifact A depends on B depends on A (transitive cycle)
  - self_referencing: Artifact references itself through dependency chain
  clarification:
    dependency_edges: 'Only dependency-carrying edges participate in cycle detection: WF_CONTAINS_NODE,
      WF_START, NODE_NEXT, CC_BINDS_CT, CC_BINDS_CS, RB_MAPS, WF_ADMITS_VIA_IN, WF_BINDS_RB, MOLECULE_COMPOSES_ATOM.
      Governance edges (GOVERNED_BY, ASSERTED_BY) are not dependency edges.

      '
    whole_graph: Cycle detection operates on the entire compiled graph, not per-artifact. A cycle spanning
      multiple artifact types (WF → CC → CT → ... → WF) is still a violation.
```
