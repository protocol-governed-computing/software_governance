# VOCAB_LANGUAGE_CONSTRAINTS_V0 — Authoring Law

**Governance Header**
- Vocabulary ID: fb.vocabulary::VOCAB_LANGUAGE_CONSTRAINTS_V0
- Version: v0
- Governed By: fb.vocabulary::CONSTITUTION_VOCABULARY_V0
- Status: Active

---

## Purpose

Defines words constrained during artifact authoring: structural keys, binding verbs, reserved words, and forbidden words.

## Allowed Usage

- `structural_keys`: As JSON object keys in protocol artifacts only
- `binding_verbs_cs`: Only within CS binding declarations
- `reserved_non_authorable`: May appear as semantic symbols but never as user-defined identifiers
- `forbidden_language`: Must NEVER appear anywhere in protocol artifacts

## Prohibited Usage

- Structural keys must NOT be used as protocol identifiers or parameter names
- Binding verbs must NOT be used in CT bindings or as identifiers
- Reserved words must NOT be used as codes, names, or keys
- Forbidden words trigger hard compiler errors in any context

## Governance Rules

- Each structural key has exactly one semantic role
- Binding verbs encode side-effect execution intent
- Reserved words are known to the compiler with explicit meaning
- Forbidden words represent deprecated or invalid language concepts
- Additions are conservative; removal requires protocol version break
