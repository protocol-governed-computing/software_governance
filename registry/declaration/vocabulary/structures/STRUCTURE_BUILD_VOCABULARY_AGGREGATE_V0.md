# STRUCTURE_BUILD_VOCABULARY_AGGREGATE_V0

Cross-structure vocabulary aggregation configuration.

## Header

- **Artifact Code:** STRUCTURE_BUILD_VOCABULARY_AGGREGATE_V0
- **Artifact Kind:** STRUCTURE
- **Governed By:** fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_STRUCTURE_V0
- **Version:** V0
- **Status:** canonical
- **Authority:** foundational

## Purpose

Declares the federated vocabulary aggregation phase.

Vocabulary generation is NOT per-structure compilation — it is federated ontology
aggregation. This artifact governs a Phase Type B aggregation: it consumes declared
compiled output surfaces from all contributing domain structures and produces the
cross-system vocabulary snapshot.

This artifact is the **sole declaration** of:
- Which compiled artifact directories contribute to vocabulary
- What artifact types are scanned per source
- Where the aggregated vocabulary output is written

No per-structure STRUCTURE artifact should declare `vocabulary_artifacts_path`.

## Doctrine

**Vocabulary generation is federated ontology aggregation, not structure compilation.**

The compiler pipeline has two phase types:
- **Phase Type A** — per-structure compilation (DISCOVER → MATERIALIZE)
- **Phase Type B** — cross-structure aggregation (consumes declared output surfaces)

This artifact governs a Phase Type B aggregation. It is invoked after all Phase Type A
builds complete. It MUST NOT be passed to the per-structure `_run_compile()` path.

## Version History

- **V0**: Initial federated vocabulary aggregation declaration (Option D implementation)
