# INVARIANT_IN_SCHEMA_REQUIRED_V0

## Machine

```yaml
fqdn: fb.intent::INVARIANT_IN_SCHEMA_REQUIRED_V0
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.governance::CONSTITUTION_INVARIANTS_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_validation
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  applies_to_kinds:
  - IN
```

---

## Purpose

Ensure every admission gate declares what it expects from incoming payloads.

---

## Validation Rules

### Rule: Schema Field Required

IN artifact must have a top-level schema field.

**Violation**:
```yaml
artifact_kind: INTENT
core:
  summary: Entry intent
# No schema field
```

### Rule: Non-Empty Schema

Schema must declare at least one field.

**Violation**:
```yaml
schema: {}  # Empty
```

### Rule: Typed Fields

Each field in schema must declare a non-empty type.

**Violation**:
```yaml
schema:
  name:
    # No type declared
```

---

## Scope

**Applies to**: All IN artifacts

**Does NOT validate**: Type correctness or field semantics (out of scope for this invariant)

---

## Version History

- **V0**: Initial implementation (2026-05-04)

---

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'Every IN artifact must declare a non-empty schema. Schema must contain at least one field,
    and each field must declare a non-empty type. Schema-less intents cannot validate admission payloads.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - missing_schema: IN artifact has no schema field
  - empty_schema: IN schema declares no fields
  - untyped_field: Schema field present but type missing or empty
  clarification:
    purpose: 'The schema is the admission contract. Without it, the intent is a pass-through gate that
      cannot reject malformed payloads.

      '
    minimal_schema: At minimum one field with a declared type is required. The schema need not be exhaustive
      but must be non-empty.
```
