## Purpose

Transport artifacts are membranes — they declare boundaries, not behavior.
Any execution logic, execution state access, or execution retry semantics inside
a transport artifact collapses the transport/execution firewall and must be
stopped at compile time.

---

## Scope

**Applies to:** All TI_ and TE_ artifacts

**Does NOT apply to:**
- CC_ artifacts within transport workflows (those are execution, not transport)
- RB_ artifacts binding transport workflows (runtime binding is a separate concern)
- Network-level retry (e.g., HTTP retries at the gateway) — transport-layer delivery

---

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'TI_ and TE_ artifacts MUST NOT participate in execution orchestration semantics.

    This invariant covers three related sub-constraints:

    (1) No execution logic: TI_ and TE_ artifacts must not contain execution steps, capability references
    (CC_, CT_, CS_), or side-effect declarations.

    (2) Execution orthogonality: Transport must not alter execution state. Transport is a membrane — it
    delivers payloads and projects results without modifying the execution graph or its intermediate state.

    (3) No execution retry semantics: Transport may retry delivery (network-level), but must not declare
    retry or re-admission logic that targets execution. Re-execution is an execution concern, not a transport
    concern.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - execution_step_in_ti: 'TI artifact declares a pipeline or step sequence

      '
  - cc_reference_in_transport: 'TI or TE artifact references a CC_, CT_, or CS_ artifact directly

      '
  - side_effect_in_te: 'TE artifact declares storage writes or external calls

      '
  - execution_retry_in_transport: 'TI or TE artifact declares retry, re-admission, or backoff targeting
      execution

      '
  - transport_alters_execution_state: Transport artifact writes to or reads from execution intermediate
      state
```
