# SURFACE_CONTRACT_STORAGE_WRITE_V0

## Header

- **Artifact Code:** SURFACE_CONTRACT_STORAGE_WRITE_V0
- **Artifact Kind:** surface_contract
- **Governed By:** fb.topology::CONSTITUTION_EXECUTION_TOPOLOGY_V0
- **Version:** V0
- **Status:** canonical

---

## Purpose

Canonical result surface for mutable storage WRITE operations.

A storage WRITE can succeed, encounter invalid input, or fail due to storage unavailability.
WRITE does not produce NOT_FOUND — a write operation creates or overwrites the document.
These three outcomes are exhaustive across all mutable storage capabilities.
