# INVARIANT_IMPLEMENTATION_ADMISSIBLE_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_INVARIANTS_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_validation
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
```

---

## Purpose

Ensure every executable capability artifact has a structurally complete implementation declaration. This is the compile-time guarantee that the runtime binding surface can resolve all execution targets.

**Core Principle**: Implementation admissibility is a compile-time invariant, not a runtime discovery.

---

## Version History

- **V0**: Initial implementation (2026-05-21) - Extracted from compiler S4 GOVERN hardcoded CT/CS validation

---

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'All capability artifacts (CT atoms and CS side effects) must declare structurally complete
    implementation specifications. An atom CT must have machine.implementation with non-empty module and
    callable. A CS must have implementation with non-empty module and callable. Without these declarations,
    the runtime binding surface is incomplete and execution cannot be resolved.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - missing_implementation: CT atom or CS with no implementation block
  - empty_module: Implementation declared but module field empty
  - empty_callable: Implementation declared but callable field empty
  clarification:
    ct_molecule_exemption: 'CT molecules (ct_kind: molecule) do NOT require direct implementation declarations
      — they compose atoms, and the atom_stream provides the execution specification. Only ct_kind: atom
      requires implementation.

      '
    cs_always_required: All CS artifacts require implementation declarations. CS artifacts interact with
      external state and must always have concrete handlers.
```
