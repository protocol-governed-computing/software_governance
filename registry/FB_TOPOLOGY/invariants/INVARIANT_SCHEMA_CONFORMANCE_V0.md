# INVARIANT_SCHEMA_CONFORMANCE_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_INVARIANTS_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_validation
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  applies_to_kinds:
  - CT
  - CS
  - CC
  - WF
  - RB
  - INVARIANT
  - CONSTITUTION
  - SURFACE
```

---

## Purpose

Ensure every governed artifact's frontmatter is structurally valid against its declared JSON schema. This is the compile-time guarantee that all artifacts entering the topology have well-formed declarations.

**Core Principle**: Schema conformance is a compile-time invariant, not a runtime discovery.

---

## Version History

- **V0**: Initial implementation (2026-05-21) - Extracted from compiler S4 GOVERN schema validation

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'All governed artifacts with a declared JSON schema must have frontmatter that validates
    against that schema. Schema conformance is a compile-time structural guarantee — no artifact with
    invalid frontmatter may enter the compiled topology. Schemas are loaded from FB_CONSTITUTION and mapped
    by artifact kind (CT, CS, CC, WF, RB, IN, EV, AC).

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - missing_required_field: Frontmatter missing a schema-required field
  - wrong_type: Frontmatter field has wrong type (e.g. string where object expected)
  - extra_unconstrained: Frontmatter contains fields not permitted by schema
  clarification:
    schema_source: Schemas are authoritative artifacts in FB_CONSTITUTION/schemas/. The schema_file_map
      in the compiler maps NodeKind to schema filename. Only artifact kinds with a declared schema are
      validated — artifact kinds without schemas pass through without validation.
```
