# INVARIANT_WF_CC_ONLY_NODES_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_INVARIANTS_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_validation
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  scope:
    applies_to:
    - WF
```

---

## Purpose

Enforce the WF → CC → CT/CS layering. Workflows orchestrate; capability contracts implement.

---

## Validation Rules

### Rule: All Non-Structural Nodes Are CC

For each node in the WF nodes map, if type is not IN or EXIT, it must be CC.

**Violation**:
```yaml
nodes:
  entry:
    type: IN
  CT_TRANSFORM_V0:       # WRONG — CT cannot be a workflow node
    type: CT
  exit:
    type: EXIT
```

**Detection**: Check type field of every node. Reject CT, CS, or unknown types.

---

## Scope

**Applies to**: All WF artifacts (platform + domains)

**Does NOT restrict**: CC artifacts invoking CTs and CSs internally

---

## Version History

- **V0**: Initial implementation (2026-05-04)

---

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'All non-structural WF nodes must be of type CC. Structural nodes (IN, EXIT) are permitted.
    Direct CT or CS node references in a workflow are forbidden — they must be encapsulated inside a CC
    artifact.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - ct_node_in_wf: Workflow node of type CT — CT must be invoked from within a CC
  - cs_node_in_wf: Workflow node of type CS — CS must be invoked from within a CC
  - unknown_node_type: Workflow node with unrecognized type
  clarification:
    structural_nodes: 'IN and EXIT are structural nodes, not capability nodes. They are always permitted
      in a workflow regardless of this invariant.

      '
    cc_encapsulation: CTs and CSs are invoked by capability contracts (CCs). The workflow orchestrates
      CCs; it does not reach into implementation details.
```
