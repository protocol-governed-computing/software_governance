# INVARIANT_BINDING_INTEGRITY_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_INVARIANTS_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_validation
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  scope:
    applies_to:
    - RB
```

---

## Purpose

Ensure RB binding surfaces are structurally sound. Every binding must point to a real, addressable artifact via its FQDN.

**Core Principle**: Binding integrity is a compile-time guarantee — no dangling references reach runtime.

---

## Validation Rules

### Rule 1: FQDN-Only Binding Keys

All `core.bindings` keys in RB artifacts must contain `::` (FQDN separator).

**Violation**: `CT_GENERATE_ID_V0` instead of `capability_transforms::CT_GENERATE_ID_V0`

### Rule 2: Binding Target Existence

All `core.bindings` keys must reference artifacts present in the compiled graph.

**Violation**: `blockchain::CT_NONEXISTENT_V0` when that artifact does not exist.

## Version History

- **V0**: Initial implementation (2026-05-21) - Extracted from compiler S4 GOVERN hardcoded RB validation

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'Runtime Binding (RB) artifacts must declare bindings only to artifacts that exist in the
    compiled graph, and all binding keys must use fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs). Bindings to non-existent
    artifacts or short-name references are inadmissible — they indicate broken execution surface.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - short_name_binding: RB binding key uses short name instead of FQDN
  - dangling_binding: RB binding key references artifact not in compiled graph
  clarification:
    fqdn_requirement: 'Binding keys must contain ''::'' (the FQDN separator). Short names are never admissible
      in binding declarations — they create ambiguity across domain boundaries.

      '
    existence_requirement: Every binding key must resolve to a node in the compiled graph. Bindings to
      removed, renamed, or misspelled artifacts are structural errors that would cause runtime failures.
```
