# INVARIANT_HANDLER_REGISTRY_CLOSED_V0

## Machine

```yaml
fqdn: compiler::INVARIANT_HANDLER_REGISTRY_CLOSED_V0
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: compiler::CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0
authority: pgc.platform
concern: compiler
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_assertion
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  applies_to_kinds:
  - COMPILER
```

---

## Purpose

Ensures the ASSERT phase is fully closed before it begins: every declared assertion
must have a registered implementation. An unregistered handler is a compiler
conformance violation — the build cannot proceed with incomplete enforcement surface.

This invariant makes the handler registry itself a governed, auditable artifact.
Any implementation that allows unregistered handlers to silently pass violates the
closed-world assumption that PGS compilation depends on.

## Relationship to CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0

Directly enforces `COMPILER_SURFACE_CLOSURE` (all references resolved at compile time)
and `COMPILER_NO_PARTIAL_RESOLUTION` (symbol resolution is all-or-nothing) as applied
to the ASSERT phase's handler surface.

---

## What this realizes
```yaml
core:
  description: 'Every ASSERT artifact present in the compiled artifact set MUST have its implementation
    handler registered in the static HANDLER_REGISTRY before the ASSERT phase executes. No ASSERT artifact
    may reference an unregistered handler. The registry is the sole authority for handler resolution —
    no dynamic discovery is permitted.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - unregistered_handler: ASSERT artifact declares implementation.module not present in HANDLER_REGISTRY
  - dynamic_resolution: Handler resolved at runtime via importlib or filesystem discovery
  - partial_registry: Registry populated incrementally during assert phase execution
```
