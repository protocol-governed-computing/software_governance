# INVARIANT_COMPILER_NO_EXECUTION_V0

## Machine

```yaml
fqdn: fb.compiler::INVARIANT_COMPILER_NO_EXECUTION_V0
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.compiler::CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_assertion
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  applies_to_kinds:
  - COMPILER
```

## Purpose

Enforces the compile-time purity boundary declared in §9 of CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0:
"Execution of protocol behavior during compilation" is a forbidden pattern.

CT and CS artifacts are pure declarations at compile time. A compiled artifact's
frontmatter must reflect the declared structure, not an execution output. If a compiled
CT artifact contains `execution_result` or `trace_id` fields, the compiler has violated
the boundary between compilation and execution.

This invariant is structural — it checks what is present in the compiled artifact, not
what the compiler did at runtime. It is checkable from the artifact alone.

## Relationship to CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0

Directly enforces §9 Forbidden Pattern #6 (`Execution of protocol behavior during
compilation`) and the CT Purity doctrine: CT implementations have zero side effects and
must never be invoked during compilation.

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'Compiled CT and CS artifacts MUST NOT carry execution-time state in their materialized
    frontmatter. Fields that only appear as the result of executing an artifact (trace_id, execution_result,
    runtime_output, invocation_id, execution_state, runtime_state) are forbidden in compiled artifact
    frontmatter. The compiler phase MUST NOT invoke CT or CS implementations — compiled artifacts are
    static declarations, not execution receipts.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - execution_state_in_frontmatter: CT/CS artifact frontmatter contains trace_id, execution_result, or
      runtime_output
  - compiler_invokes_ct: Compiler phase calls CT implementation module during compilation
  - compiler_invokes_cs: Compiler phase calls CS implementation module during compilation
  - execution_contamination: Compiled artifact preserves side-effect outputs in its canonical form
```
