## Purpose

This constitution governs the cryptographic trust posture under which PGS execution is
authorized. It answers: *what cryptographic guarantees are required for this snapshot to
be considered trustworthy and legally executable?*

Trust posture is a governance declaration, not a runtime configuration. The compiler
validates the declared trust mode; runtimes execute under it passively. This ensures
that moving from unsigned local development to signed, attested, or encrypted deployment
is a governance change, not a code change.

## §1. V0 Trust Mode

The only authorized trust mode in V0 is `LOCAL_DEV_UNSIGNED`.

This means:
- Snapshots are not required to carry cryptographic signatures
- Payloads are not encrypted or sealed
- Runtime processes are not attested
- Transport channels are not required to be encrypted

This is the correct posture for local development and single-node execution.
It is explicitly declared — not assumed — which is the important distinction.

## §2. What "Trust" Means in PGS

Cryptographic trust governs confidence in the integrity and provenance of execution
artifacts: the snapshot, the payload, the runtime process, and the transport channel.
It does not govern identity trust (FB_IDENTITY) or authority delegation (FB_AUTHORITY).

| Concern | Governed By |
|---------|-------------|
| Snapshot integrity | FB_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_TRUST |
| Payload confidentiality | FB_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_TRUST |
| Runtime process attestation | FB_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_TRUST |
| Transport channel security | FB_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_TRUST |
| Identity legality | FB_IDENTITY |
| Authority delegation | FB_AUTHORITY |

## §3. Compiler Behavior

The compiler MUST:
- Discover the active trust contract in this boundary
- Validate that exactly one contract is active
- Materialize trust mode into the snapshot federation profile under:

```yaml
federation_profile:
  cryptographic_trust: LOCAL_DEV_UNSIGNED
```

## §4. Runtime Behavior

The runtime MUST:
- Record `federation_profile.cryptographic_trust` in trace metadata
- NOT perform signature verification, decryption, or attestation in V0
- NOT branch on trust mode values

## §5. Future Expansion Path

```
LOCAL_DEV_UNSIGNED
  → SIGNED_SNAPSHOT        (snapshot carries verifiable signature)
  → SEALED_PAYLOAD         (payload encrypted; signing required)
  → ATTESTED_RUNTIME       (runtime process attested; sealing required)
  → ENCRYPTED_TUNNEL       (transport encrypted; attestation required)
```

Each step requires a new trust contract. Runtime enforcement capability arrives
with Runtime V3+.

## §6. Versioning

Changes to trust semantics require a new constitution version and migration rationale.

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'Declares the cryptographic trust regime active for a compiled snapshot.

    Governs whether snapshots must be signed, payloads sealed, runtimes attested,

    and transport encrypted. Trust mode is a compile-time declaration — runtimes

    execute under the declared trust posture rather than negotiating it.


    In V0, the trust mode is LOCAL_DEV_UNSIGNED: no cryptographic verification

    is required. This seeds the governance axis for future signed, sealed, and

    attested execution without any protocol redesign.

    '
  summary: Governs snapshot signing, payload sealing, runtime attestation, encrypted transport, and trust
    admissibility
rules:
- rule_id: TRUST_MODE_MUST_BE_DECLARED
  constraint: 'Every compiled snapshot MUST declare exactly one active trust contract. A snapshot with
    no trust declaration is a compiler validation failure.

    '
- rule_id: TRUST_MODES_ARE_ADDITIVE
  constraint: 'Trust modes are cumulative. SIGNED_SNAPSHOT requires signing but not payload encryption.
    SEALED_PAYLOAD requires both signing and payload encryption. ATTESTED_RUNTIME additionally requires
    runtime attestation. Each mode is a superset of the previous.

    '
- rule_id: UNSIGNED_SNAPSHOTS_LOCAL_ONLY
  constraint: 'Snapshots compiled with LOCAL_DEV_UNSIGNED trust mode MUST NOT be deployed to non-local
    execution substrates. This is enforced by governance process at V0; future compiler validation will
    assert this mechanically.

    '
- rule_id: TRUST_IS_NOT_TRANSPORT
  constraint: 'FB_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_TRUST governs cryptographic trust posture only. It MUST NOT govern transport
    protocols, network routing, or TLS configuration. Transport security is an infrastructure concern;
    trust posture is a governance concern.

    '
- rule_id: RUNTIME_READS_TRUST_PASSIVELY
  constraint: 'Runtime MAY read the active trust contract for trace metadata emission. Runtime MUST NOT
    branch on trust mode or perform signature verification, payload decryption, or attestation checks.
    In V0, all such checks are absent. Future trust enforcement is a runtime evolution concern (V3+).

    '
