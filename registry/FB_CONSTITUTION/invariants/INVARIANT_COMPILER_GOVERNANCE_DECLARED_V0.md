# INVARIANT_COMPILER_GOVERNANCE_DECLARED_V0

## Machine

```yaml
artifact_kind: INVARIANT
version: V0
governed_by: fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0
core:
  enforcement_stage:
  - compiler_assertion
  violation_response: FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
assert_projection:
  scope:
    applies_to:
    - COMPILER
```

---

## Purpose

Enforces `COMPILER_SELF_APPLICABLE` from CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0: the compiler must
be capable of validating its own governance artifacts, which requires those artifacts to
be present in the compiled set.

The phase sequence and compiler rules are governance declarations — they live in the
constitution as static constraints that conforming compilers must satisfy. They are NOT
execution instructions that a compiler reads and interprets at runtime to determine what
to do next.

A compiler that reads `CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0` at runtime to decide phase ordering has
inverted the model: governance drives execution rather than governing it.

## Relationship to CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0

Directly enforces `COMPILER_SELF_APPLICABLE` (compiler validates its own governance)
and validates that the static declaration surface is present and non-empty. The
assertion is structural — it checks the artifact exists and is well-formed, not that
the runtime interprets it.

## Rule Statement

```yaml
core:
  description: 'CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0 MUST be present in every compiled artifact set. Its machine block
    MUST declare a non-empty rules list that includes the governing constraints for the compiler pipeline.
    The compiler constitution is a static governance declaration — not an execution instruction set. Absence
    of the constitution from the compiled set violates COMPILER_SELF_APPLICABLE.

    '
  anti_patterns:
  - missing_constitution: CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0 absent from compiled artifact set
  - empty_rules: CONSTITUTION_COMPILER_V0 machine block has no declared rules
  - runtime_phase_discovery: Compiler reads its own governance artifacts to determine execution order
      at runtime
```
